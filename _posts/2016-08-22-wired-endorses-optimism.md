  WIRED has never been neutral. For nearly a quarter of a century, this
  organization has championed a specific way of thinking about tomorrow. If it's
  true, as the writer William Gibson once had it, that the future is already
  here, just unevenly distributed, then our task has been to locate the places
  where various futures break through to our present and identify which one we
  hope for.
