  @starvingphotographer has teamed up with @sonyalpha to collaborate in a
  competition. Mahesh has supplied many of his images in RAW & JPEG form to edit
  and add to the competition hashtag #SPxAlpha. You must be following both to
  participate. Here is my last edit. Check out @starvingphotographer for more
  details about this competition (Download link in his bio).
